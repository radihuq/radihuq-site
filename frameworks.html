            <h2><strong>My Frameworks and Mental Models</strong></h2>
            <p>I like to derive things into frameworks because it helps me understand the systems that build this world.</p>

            <p>Here is a non-exhaustive list of frameworks and mental models. Each one is in a constant state of work-in-progress as I continue figure out more and more about this universe.</p>

            <h3 id="valueInSociety">Your Value in Society</h3>

            <p>
                Your value in society is composed of three factors: your <mark>human capital</mark>, <mark>social capital</mark>, and <mark>financial capital</mark>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><mark>human capital</mark> = <strong>skills</strong>: what are you good at?</li>
                <li><mark>social capital</mark> = <strong>network</strong>: who do you know?</li>
                <li><mark>financial capital</mark> = <strong>wealth</strong>: how much money do you have?</li>
                <li>The formula is something like: <mark>ValueInSociety = COEFFICIENT * SUM((x * human capital) + (y * social capital) + (z * financial capital))</mark></li>
                <li>I haven't figured out the <mark>x</mark>, <mark>y</mark>, <mark>z</mark> multipliers yet.</li>
                <li>There is also an overall coefficient factor. I haven't figured that part out yet either. Maybe its something intangible like your ability to instill a level of trust & comfort in others?</li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <h3>The Strength of an Organization</h3>

            <p>How strong is an organization?</p>
        

            <ul>
                <li>I think the formula is something like: <mark>StrengthOfOrganization = MISSION_COEFFICIENT * (KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER_COEFFICIENT * SUM(EachMemberValueInSociety))</mark></li>
                <li><mark>MISSION_COEFFICENT</mark> = what is the average organization member's alignment with the mission?</li>
                <li><mark>KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER_COEFFICIENT</mark> = how effectively & efficiently are you able to transfer knowledge between the organization's members?</li>
                <li><mark>EachMemberValueInSociety</mark> = each member's value in society; see: <a href='#valueInSociety'>Your Value in Society</a></li>
            </ul>

            <hr />

            <h3>Effective Communication</h3>
            
            <p>Communicating is very hard; you will never be able to transfer an idea in your head to another person 1:1 because there's latency in how you encode the message, and how latency in how they decode the message.</p>
            <p>Communicating with someone else is a dance, its an art. It's very hard.
                
            <p>Try your best: forget what you're taught about in school around "professional writing" - use easy-to-understand words, use less words, and don't be afraid to use emotional characters like emojis or "LOL" or "..." or anything. Communication is hard!!! Make it easy for them to understand your message, your emotions, and your intent.</p>
        
            <hr />

            <h3>Anxiety</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety = fear of the future unknown</li>
            </ul>
        
            <hr />

            <h3>Negotitating a Job's Compensation Package</h3>

            <p>This framework mostly optimizes for highest financial compensation.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Do you have backup options (leverage)? If not, you're at their mercy. That's ok. Just be ok with that</li>
                <li>Have three packages: <mark>Minimum</mark>, <mark>Content</mark>, <mark>Moonshot</mark></li>
            </ul>

            <ul>                
                <li>For each package, write down desired <mark>salary</mark>, <mark>equity</mark>, <mark>vacation days</mark>, <mark>signing bonus</mark>, <mark>benefits</mark>
                <li><mark>salary</mark>: how much money do you want to make per year?</li>
                <li><mark>equity</mark>: how much ownership in the company do you want? (also worth considering vesting schedule; 4yrs w/1yr cliff is standard and ok for me) (you can also consider RSUs vs. options, but that's too complicated for me right now so I don't really care)</li>
                <li><mark>vacation days</mark>: how many vacation days do you want per year?</li>
                <li><mark>signing bonus</mark>: how much money do you want to get as soon as you sign the job offer?</li>
                <li><mark>benefits</mark>: what other benefits do you want? Like RRSP matching, monthly stipends, health benefits, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><mark>Minimum package</mark>: the absolute minimum you'll take. You won't get paid much, but you are ok with that as long as the non-tangibles are great like you'll learn A LOT, get good benefits, etc.</li>
                <li><mark>Content package</mark>: you'll get paid about industry average. It's a balanced option - the salary is good and the non-tangibles are good</li>
                <li><mark>Moonshot package</mark>: your salary is a ton. Forget about the non-tangibles, you take this because you're gonna make fuck you money</li>
            </ul>
